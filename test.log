Phase 1: Parsing components...
Added component node timer
Added component node t1
Added component node t2
Added component node t3
Added component node t4
Added component node pip
Added component node propagation
Added component node ipcp
Phase 2: Parsing connections...
Parsed from node t1
Parsed from node t2
Added connection conn_pip (pip.r)
Added edge pip.r -> pip
Added edge t1 -> pip.r
Added edge t2 -> pip.r
Parsed from node t3
Parsed from node t4
Added connection conn_propagation (propagation.r)
Added edge propagation.r -> propagation
Added edge t3 -> propagation.r
Added edge t4 -> propagation.r
Parsed from node pip
Parsed from node propagation
Added connection conn_ipcp (ipcp.r)
Added edge ipcp.r -> ipcp
Added edge pip -> ipcp.r
Added edge propagation -> ipcp.r
Parsed from node t1
Parsed from node t2
Parsed from node t3
Parsed from node t4
Added connection periodic (timer.the_timer)
Added edge timer.the_timer -> timer
Added edge t1 -> timer.the_timer
Added edge t2 -> timer.the_timer
Added edge t3 -> timer.the_timer
Added edge t4 -> timer.the_timer
Phase 3: Parsing priorities...
Set priority of t1 to 10
Set priority of t2 to 30
Set priority of t3 to 20
Set priority of t4 to 40
Phase 4: Parsing protocols...
Set protocol of pip.r to inherited
Set protocol of propagation.r to propagated
Set protocol of ipcp.r to fixed
Finished parsing. Printing...
